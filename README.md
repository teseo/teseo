## Hey there

Senior fullstack engineer based in Edinburgh with 20+ years shipping software. When I'm not solving problems for companies, I build things I actually want to use — from Twitch bots to AI-powered tools and mobile apps.

Also a musician who streams, so I build my own tools to process VODs. 100% local AI when possible, cloud APIs when needed.

**Currently working with:** TypeScript · React · React Native · Bun · Node.js · Python · AWS · PHP

**Experience with:** Local LLMs (Ollama, Whisper) · OpenAI API · Claude API · DeepSeek API · FFmpeg
