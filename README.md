## Hey there

Agentic AI Engineer based in Edinburgh with 21+ years shipping software. I orchestrate AI agents across the full development cycle.

When I'm not solving problems for companies, I build things I actually want to use: Twitch bots, AI-powered tools, mobile apps. Also a musician who streams, so I build my own tools to process VODs. 100% local AI when possible, cloud LLM APIs when needed.

**Currently working with:** TypeScript · Node.js · React · React Native · AWS · Claude Code · Codex CLI

**Agentic AI stack:** Claude · OpenAI · Gemini · DeepSeek · Ollama · Whisper · MCP integrations · FFmpeg
